Overview

The SP_LOAD_EMPLOYEE_DATA procedure facilitates the synchronization of employee data from the HR schema into the data warehouse. It ensures that any updates or new records in the source table (HR.EMPLOYEES) are accurately reflected in the target table (DATA_WAREHOUSE.EMPLOYEE_DATA). This procedure is critical for maintaining data consistency and integrity across systems.
Functionality

The procedure performs the following key functions:

    Fetch Data: Retrieves employee records from the HR.EMPLOYEES table based on a specified criterion (e.g., LAST_UPDATE_DATE within the last 24 hours).

    Merge Operation: Utilizes a MERGE statement to reconcile the differences between the source and target tables:
        Updates existing records in DATA_WAREHOUSE.EMPLOYEE_DATA if an employee record with the same EMPLOYEE_ID already exists.
        Inserts new records into DATA_WAREHOUSE.EMPLOYEE_DATA if no matching EMPLOYEE_ID is found.

    Error Handling: Implements robust error handling to capture and manage exceptions that may occur during data synchronization. Error messages are logged for diagnostic purposes.

Usage

To execute the SP_LOAD_EMPLOYEE_DATA procedure:

    Permissions: Ensure that the executing user has appropriate privileges (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE) on both HR.EMPLOYEES and DATA_WAREHOUSE.EMPLOYEE_DATA tables.

    Execution: Call the procedure to initiate the synchronization process. Example:

    sql

    EXEC SP_LOAD_EMPLOYEE_DATA;

    Monitoring: Monitor the procedure execution for any messages or errors generated by the system using standard output mechanisms (DBMS_OUTPUT, logging, etc.).

Considerations

    Performance: Optimize the procedure for performance, considering factors such as data volume, indexing strategies, and query optimization.

    Transaction Management: Ensure proper transaction management to maintain data integrity. Use COMMIT to finalize changes upon successful synchronization.

    Security: Implement security best practices to protect sensitive data during synchronization operations.
